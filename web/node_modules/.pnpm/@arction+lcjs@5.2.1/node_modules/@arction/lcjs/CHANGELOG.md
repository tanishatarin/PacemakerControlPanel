### Deprecated

## [5.2.0] - 2024-05-07

### Added

-   Added **Stacked Axes** (beta)
    -   Accessed via `AxisOptions.iStack`, `Axis.setLength`, `Axis.setMargins`
    -   See online examples and/or Developer documentation (Features > Axis) for latest updates to stacked axis use cases.
-   Added `TreeMapChart`
-   Added `ChartXY.swapAxes` (beta)
    - Can be used to swap the position of two stacked Axes.
-   Added `ImageFill` support for `PointLineAreaSeries` and `PolarPointSeries` marker fill styles
    -   Allows displaying custom picture assets in axis coordinates with axis clipping.
-   Added `PointLineAreaSeries.setPointAlignment`, `getPointAlignment`
    -   Allows display of non-centered points. For example, position points by vertical bottom.
-   Added convenience axis getter properties
    -   `ChartXY.axisX`, `xAxis`, `axisY`, `yAxis`
    -   `Chart3D.axisX`, `xAxis`, `axisY`, `yAxis`, `axisZ`, `zAxis`
    -   `PolarChart.axisRadial`, `axisAmplitude`, `radialAxis`, `amplitudeAxis`
    -   These behave exactly same as `getDefaultAxisX()` or equivalents, but simply look more neat.
-   Added `SeriesOptions.axisX`, `SeriesOptions.axisY`
    -   Convenience properties that do exactly same as existing `xAxis` and `yAxis`
-   Added convenience properties `SeriesXY.xAxis`, `SeriesXY.yAxis`
-   Added `DisposableEvents.isDisposed`
    -   This simple getter is added to basically all charts, series, etc. objects
    -   Introduced mainly to workaround some issues in React run-time crashes
-   Added `LightningChart.layout`
    -   Required for React applications which use shared LC context and include charts inside scrollable DIVs which are not the document body. Used to notify charts that their position on the webpage may have changed.
-   Added `ChartComponent.setIcon` (beta)
    -   This can be used to associate a chart component with a icon graphic. For many series types this results in automatically displaying that Icon in legends and cursors.
-   Added ability to use `Icon` anywhere `PointShape` can be used.
    -   XY point series, Polar point series, Point markers, Legend entries, Checkboxes
    -   Additionally, Icons can now be used as part of Result table content
-   Added `DataSetXY.fill`, `PointLineAreaSeries.fill` methods
    -   Convenient way to set same value to all existing samples. Especially useful for implementing custom interactions, like highlighting selected data 
-   Added `setTickStyle` convenience methods to all tick strategies.
    -   This does the same as existing `setMajorTickStyle` and `setMinorTickStyle` but applies both with just 1 method call.points with different color/size etc.
-   Added more optional parameters to `DataSetXY.alterSamplesByID` and `PointLineAreaSeries.alterSamplesByID`: `x`, `y`, `lookupValue`, `color`, `rotation`
    -   Can be used to load same value for all specified sample IDs.
-   Added `Axis.setTitleMarginBefore`, `getTitleMarginBefore`
-   Added `Axis.setAutoRegionsEnabled`
    -   Can be used to disable built-in functionality that adds extra gaps around axis interval to make sure that attached series fit inside. In some specific cases this is necessary.
-   Added `hasUIElementBackground` type guard.
-   Added `Color.toUint32`
-   Added slice parameter to sliced chart slice styling APIs
    -   Allows referencing slice label and other properties in custom style use cases

### Removed

-   Removed `EngineSettings.webgl`
    -   This property was faulty since v5.0.0, and didn't actually do anything. Use `LightningChartOptions.webgl` instead

### Fixed

-   Fixed bug `synchronizeAxisIntervals` resulting in axes not being zoomable or pannable.
-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries` run-time crash "invalid array length" sometimes when using time-series data and zooming in/out.
-   Fixed long scroll animations in time-series use cases when first data points are added.
-   Fixed charts not following changes to window devicePixelRatio after chart is created
    -   This can be observed by text staying sharp and thicknesses/point sizes adjusting when using browser zooming
    -   Note that in order for this to work, web site needs to have meta tag meta[name="viewport"] width=device-width
-   Made `PointLineAreaSeries` more robust to common invalid data supply patterns in data streaming test setups.
    -   e.g. data points sharing same time coordinate, or even having slightly incorrect order.
-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries` individual point sizes low resolution with circle shape.
-   Fixed `PointLineAreaSeries.clear` resulting in series not being visible under specific circumstances.
-   Fixed axis gridlines invisible with light theme.
-   Fixed extreme ticklines not visible.
-   Fixed crash when attempting to dispose same chart twice.
-   Fixed sliced charts (pie, pyramid, funnel) auto cursors not updating on mouse move when highlight on hover is disabled.
-   Fixed legend button not showing if legend is added while attached component is invisible.
-   Fixed `alterSamples` not doing anything if only `sizes` or `rotations` were altered.
-   Fixed Legend entry hiding itself even when toggleVisibilityOnClick is false
-   Fixed BarChart sometimes disabling animations even if they are explicitly enabled or not disabled at least.

### Deprecated

-   Deprecated `LightningChartOptions.sharedContextOptions.webgl` in favour of `LightningChartOptions.webgl`
-   Deprecated `Axis.setTitleMargin`, `getTitleMargin`
    -   For clearer distinction should use `Axis.setMarginAfterTitle` instead

## [5.1.1] - 2024-02-19

    -   Allows modification of button shape during run-time. Previously had to be specified before creating checkbox
-   Added beta feature `DateTimeTickStrategy.setUTC`
    -   Allows tick placement to be done in UTC (instead of clients local region), removing any region specific day light saving and time zone offsets

### Changed

-   `ChartXY.getDefaultAxisX` and `getDefaultAxisY` methods now return the first Axis that is visible.
    -   Previously even invisible Axis may be returned.
-   `ChartXY` rectangle zoom interaction now works regardless of mouse gesture direction if rectangle fit interaction is disabled (setMouseInteractionRectangleFit(false))
-   Tweaked built-in themes for `BarChart`
    -   Changed gradients to solid fills
    -   Added subtle borders
    -   This was done to accommodate for new Grouped and Stacked BarCharts that are contained within the same chart type.

-   Fixed hidden axis taking space
-   Fixed `ChartXY` animationsEnabled and disableAnimations options being applied opposite to afterwards added Axis
-   Greatly improved LUT precision
    -   Previously some users were facing issues with LUT picking wrong color when the value was very close to a threshold. For example, couple decimals off, or sometimes when the magnitude of the numbers was very large.
-   Improved DataGrid performance with large number of text and most of it outside view.
-   Fixed minor memory leak when using Dashboard and disposing charts inside it
    -   Introduced in v5.0.0
-   Fixed crash on `LegendBox.setVisible(false)` when a LUT is attached.

### Deprecated

-   Deprecated `start`, `step` and `end` options when creating Heatmap or Surface grids.
    -   Usage should be replaced with `setStart`, `setStep` and `setEnd` methods respectively.

## [5.0.7] - 2024-01-19

### Fixed

-   Fixed typings issue when using library from NPM.
    -   Reported at least from React and Vite frameworks, types were not found from package.

### Fixed

-   Fixed auto cursor not updating when moving mouse over a heatmap
-   Fixed ChartXY.solveNearest and other equivalent methods missing.

## [5.0.5] - 2023-12-13

### Changed

-   Improved license validation errors to not throw errors that crash applications.
    -   This makes it easier to work with applications where not every person running it will need charts to be visible.

### Fixed

-   Fixed CSS issue where chart starts expanding height infinitely, shows as white and uses a lot of CPU
-   Fixed ChartXY animationsEnabled and disableAnimations options being applied opposite to afterwards added Axis

## [5.0.4] - 2023-12-01

### Added

-   Added `formatNumberAsUnicodeSuperscript`
-   Added new file to release bundle: `dist/lcjs.iife.d.ts`
    -   This contains typings compatible with the IIFE distribution (`dist/lcjs.iife.js`)
    -   Can be used to get basic intellisense in simplistic applications that are directly utilizing the IIFE library.
    -   For example, see https://lightningchart.com/js-charts/docs/frameworks/aaa-vanilla/

### Changed

-   Tweaked axis restrictions on logarithmic axis to prevent situations where 0 axis ticks are visible
-   Added new alternate, built-in option for logarithmic tick formatting
    -   Formats values like 10¹, 10², 10³, ...
    -   See `FormattingFunctions.LogarithmicNoExponentsRounded)`

### Fixed

-   Fixed extra jitter in ChartXY zoom to fit animation
-   Fixed all log axis ticks being hidden if any major tick collides with another
    -   Now only colliding ticks are hidden.
-   Fixed BarChart license error even though license was valid
-   Fixed tick behavior issue when either numeric extreme tick or date time great tick collided with another tick.
    -   Instead of hiding colliding tick, the entire tick level was sometimes not displayed

## [5.0.3] - 2023-11-10

### Fixed

-   Fixed ZoomBand Chart resources not included in package
-   Fixed crash when using sandbox licensing and initiating `lightningChart()` several times.

## [5.0.0] - 2023-11-08

### Added

-   Shared WebGL Context rendering.
    -   Removes the old 16 chart limit. Now you can have 1000+ charts on a single page depending on the hardware running the page.
    -   Has two modes:
        -    Individual canvas mode. In this mode each chart is render to it's own canvas. This is the default mode.
        -    Shared canvas mode. All charts are render to a single shared canvas. Can have better performance than the individual canvas mode.
    -   See Developer Documentation "Grouping charts" for more information
    -   Starting with LCJS v5.0.0, it's important to do only one call to the `lightningChart()` library entry point function. You should call this function once and create all of the charts from the same returned object
-   Added automatic sandbox licensing.
    -   When charts are used in specific, popular sandbox sites (like Stack Overflow, Codepen, JSFiddle), the charts work automatically, without passing any license.
-   New event `isInView`
    -   This event is triggered when a chart becomes visible in the browser viewport.
-   `dispose()` to the library entry point interface (`lightningChart()`)`
    -   This can be used to dispose the shared WebGL context and all charts that have been created with it.
-   Added option to have different fonts and fill styles within result table content.
    -   See changes to `ResultTableContent` and `TableContentBuilder.addRow`
-   Added `PointShape.Arrow`, `Cross`, `Diamond`, `Minus`, `Plus`, `Star`
-   Added `HeatmapScrollingGridSeriesIntensityValues.invalidateIntensityValues`, `getSampleCount` methods
    -   Allows backwards invalidation of previously added samples and pushing data by sample index.
    -   Directed to make heatmap time series applications more convenient.
-   Added `MapChart.getRegionUnderMouse`
-   Added `ResultTable.setPadding`, `ResultTable.getPadding`
-   Added auto cursors to `PieChart`, `FunnelChart` and `PyramidChart`
    -   New methods: `setAutoCursor`, `getAutoCursor`, `setAutoCursorMode`, `getAutoCursorMode`, `setCursorResultTableFormatter`
-   Added optional `matchStyleExactly` flag when adding components to legend box to match button color exactly to attached components rather than making default gradient
-   Added `PieChartWithLabelsOnSides.setLabelSliceOffset`, `getLabelSliceOffset`, `setLabelConnectorGapStart`, `getLabelConnectorGapStart`, `setLabelConnectorEndLength`, `getLabelConnectorEndLength`
-   Added option to `captureFrame` method to return the result as a Data URL.
    -   See LegendBoxAddOptions in API reference to learn more.
-   Added `UICheckBox.setTextFillStyleHidden`, `getTextFillStyleHidden` methods

### Changed

-   Changed non-commercial license terms
    -   Before, omitting license key meant approving to non-commercial use terms
    -   Now, license key is always required. Get a license at `https://lightningchart.com/js-charts/#license-key`
-   Reworked `OHLCSeries`.
    -   Performance massively improved. Loading time 40x faster, data capacity 200x more (average desktop GPU).
    -   See migration guide for instructions of using reworked feature.
-   Reworked `ZoomBandChart`
    -   The feature has been reimplemented from scratch with two goals: better UX + simpler API.
    -   See migration guide for details.
-   Refactored `FigureSeries` (`RectangleSeries`, `SegmentSeries`, `PolygonSeries`, `BoxSeries`, `EllipseSeries`)
    -   Main motivation to improve performance greatly, enabling use cases that need large numbers of figures.
    -   New implementation is much more performance efficient, on average ~50x more powerful or even more.
-   Changed visual look of `LegendBox` buttons.
    -   Now the text and button are dimmed when series is hidden, rather than the previous "check box ticked" approach.
-   Built-in `Themes` cursor gridstroke style changed to `DashedLine`
-   Changed interfaces around tick styles.
    -   `TickStyle` should now be only needed interface. It has all APIs necessary for styling axis ticks.
    -   `emptyTick` can be used as convenience to hide ticks completely.
    -   `VisibleTicks` and `EmptyTicks` classes are removed.
    -   When mutating a tick style, there is no longer a need to check `isVisibleTicks` in TypeScript applications.
    -   This should mainly remove type errors, rather than introduce them.
-   Changed `Theme` properties:
    -   Some deprecated `Theme` properties have been removed, and new ones introduced and made non-optional to accommodate for new features.
    -   For details, see migration guide.
-   `LegendBox` buttons now match the shape of attached point-based series.
    -   Concerns following series: `PointSeries`, `PointLineSeries`, `StepSeries`, `SplineSeries`, `PolarPointSeries`, `PolarPointLineSeries` and `SpiderSeries`.
    -   If this behavior is undesirable, it can be prevented like: `LegendBox.add(component, { builder: UIElementBuilders.CheckBox })`
    -   This also let's you choose any shape from `PointShape` collection. See `LegendBoxAddOptions` in API reference for more information.
-   Changed parameters of `onHighlight` methods.
    -   First parameter is now reference to object itself. Other parameters shifted right.
    -   Change done to be symmetrical with other event APIs.
-   Changed parameters of `CustomTick.onValueChange` method.
    -   First parameter is now reference to object itself. Other parameters shifted right.
    -   Change done to be symmetrical with other event APIs.
-   Changed `PointMarker` API
    -   Removed `setStrokeStyle`, `getStrokeStyle`
    -   Added `setShape`, `getShape`, `setRotation`, `getRotation`
    -   PointMarkers can no longer have borders, but their shape and rotation can be easily changed.
-   Changed default look of cursor PointMarkers
    -   Previously was not visible, now it is a small crosshair
    -   To restore previous look you can either use `chart.setAutoCursor((cursor) => cursor.setPointMarkerVisible(false))` or `theme: { ...Themes.darkGold, cursorPointMarkerFillStyle: emptyFill }`
-   `CursorPoint.series` property name changed to `owner` and type to `unknown`.
-   `PieChartWithLabelsOnSides` visual look changed.
    -   Labels are now next to labels rather than at left/right edges of chart area.
-   Moved `SpiderChart` axis nibs draw order behind series.
    -   This was causing some cursor interaction issues due to the nibs having priority over series

### Removed

-   Removed `BoxAndWhiskers`, `BoxFigureConstructor`, `CustomizableFigure`, `SimpleFigureSeries`
    -   Can be replaced with `BoxSeries`, `BoxFigure`
-   Removed `Figure.setHighlight`, `getHighlight`, `onHighlight`, `offHighlight` methods
    -   They can still be used via the `FigureSeries` (same value shared for all figures)
-   Removed `VisibleTicks`, `isVisibleTicks`
    -   Can be replaced with `TickStyle`, `isTickStyle`
-   Removed `MarkerBuilders.XY`
    -   Can be replaced with `MarkerBuilders.ChartMarkerXY` or `MarkerBuilders.SeriesMarkerXY` instead
-   Removed `PointMarkers`, `EmptyPointMarker`, all generic type parameters related to `PointMarkers`
    -   `PointMarker` concept still exists, but has been simplified. See `PointMarker` in API reference for more information.
-   Removed `PieChartWithLabelsOnSides.getLabelConnectorGap`, `getLabelConnectorLength`, `setLabelConnectorGap`, `setLabelConnectorLength`
-   Removed `UICheckBoxBuilder.setPictureOff`, `setPictureOn` methods
    -   Replaced by `setButtonShape` method
-   Removed `UICheckBox.setButtonOffSize`, `setButtonOnSize` methods
    -   Replaced by `setButtonSize` method
-   Removed `UICheckBox.setButtonOnStrokeStyle`, `setButtonOffStrokeStyle` methods
    -   No equivalent method exists, check boxes no longer have borders, only fill style.

### Fixed

-   Fixed some Firefox specific render and console warning issues
    -   `MapChart` stroke not rendered and potentially other unidentified occurences.
-   Fixed `ChartXY` series background border sometimes being clipped 1 pixel on some sides
-   Fixed `ChartXY` axis stroke not aligning with series background border
    -   Before axis stroke was offset by half its thickness so they partially overlapped.
-   Fixed effects leaking outside series area
-   Fixed `PieChartWithLabelsOnSides` pushing labels out of view.
-   Minor CPU performance optimizations for all chart types.
-   Fixed `BarChart` category axis title mispositioned with bipolar data set
-   Improved some situations where `BarChart` looked off when it had not been supplied data yet
-   Fixed `BarChart` value axis gridstroke plotted in wrong direction
-   Fixed `ZoomBandChart` missing series background style API

### Deprecated

-   Added `BarChart`
    -   Dedicated chart type for visualizing categorical data with convenient high level end user API.
    -   Features (to mention some): cursor, sorting, animations, overlapping label hiding, different label position options, events API, high performance, support for large number of bars, logarithmic value axis, vertical + horizontal bars.
-   `Control.translateCoordinate`
    -   This method is present on all chart types and Dashboard
    -   It replaces `translatePoint` and similar previous APIs.
-   Added TimeTickStrategy.setFormattingFunction, setMajorFormattingFunction, setMinorFormattingFunction

-   Added `Control.onResize`, `Control.offResize`
    -   Methods were missing for `Dashboard` and `ZoomBandChart`
-   Added type guards for all style objects.
    -   `isSolidFill`, `isSolidLine`, `isFontSettings`, etc.

### Fixed

-   Fixed `FormattingFunctions.NumericUnits` sometimes not adding decimal places where necessary.
-   Fixed errors and crashes when supplying LCJS with style objects created from separate ES module based library.
    -   Problem appeared when using `lcjs-themes`, for example.

    -   See `Control.translateCoordinate` for newer syntax of coordinate translations
-   Deprecated previous method signature of `solveNearestFromScreen`
    -   New signature was added to replace it. It expects object with { clientX: number, clientY: number } properties, instead of { x: number, y: number }. These values should be proper HTML client coordinates rather than internal LCJS engine coordinates like before.
-   Deprecated `pixelScale` properties.
    -   Use `coordsRelative` property instead, it works exactly same.
-   Deprecated Chart3D.world, Chart3D.axes over Chart3D.coordsWorld, Chart3D.coordsAxis

## [4.1.2] - 2023-06-22

-   Added `MapChart` highlighting.
    -   Hovering mouse on attached legend entry highlights the whole map.
    -   Hovering mouse over a region highlights that region. This can be disabled with `MapChart.setHighlightOnHover`
-   Added `CustomTick3D`
-   Added `DashedLine`
    -   Type of `LineStyle`
    -   Supported by selected features: Axis, ConstantLine, Ticks, CustomTick, SegmentSeries, LineSeries, PointLineSeries, StepSeries, SplineSeries, AreaSeries, AreaRangeSeries

### Changed

-   Greatly improved `MapChart` performance (CPU & GPU use reduced)
-   Logarithmic axis no longer throws errors and alerts if data is in invalid log range.
    -   May lead to apps having log axes with impossible intervals. In this case, visualization will not make sense or might behave weird.
-   Improved 2D Point Series loading speed.

### Fixed

-   Fixed `PointSeries` and `PointSeries3D` not supporting `LUT.color` when using value palette coloring.

-   Reduced amount of WebGL warnings thrown by FireFox.
    -   "ClientWaitSync must return TIMEOUT_EXPIRED" warning is now shown less.
-   Fixed LightningChart Logo showing up as a black box when only WebGL 1 was available.
-   Fixed WebGL warning for deprecated Alpha-premult for non-DOM-element uploads.

## [4.0.0] - 2023-02-06

### Added

-   Added `isThemeDark(Theme)` function to check if selected theme is dark or light
    -   Intended to be used on default library themes only, not custom user themes.
-   Added `EngineSettings.pickingPrecision` for modifying user interactions precision.
    -   This should not be required in normal use cases, but exists just in case.

    -   This API can be used to hide an element from rendering but still keep updating it in the background.
-   Added `onVisibleStateChanged` / `offVisibleStateChanged` event listener to most elements that support `setVisible`.
    -   This event will be triggered when the visibility of an element is actually changed.
-   Added `Hideable` interface.
    -   This interface is implemented by everything that can be hidden with `setVisible`.

### Changed

-   Changed end user APIs that accepted rotations as radians to work with degrees instead:
    -   Data point `rotation` property was previously interpreted as radian, now as degrees
-   ChartXY and Chart3D default interactions now also work over series, instead of just series background
-   Theme interface now requires `isDark` property.
    -   For user defined Themes, you may set this to any value safely. It only interacts with `isThemeDark` convenience function.
-   Improved some default user interactions on trackpad
    -   Affects: ChartXY zoom, Axis zoom, Chart3D zoom
    -   Zooming now responds better according to user interaction behavior (small movement = small effect, etc.)
-   Changed Chart3D zoom animation to be smoother
-   Creating LightningChart component on user supplied DIV no longer overrides `style.position` if it was previously assigned by user
-   Renamed `setHighlighted` -> `setHighlight` and `getHighlighted` -> `getHighlight`
    -   New method now accepts boolean or a number between 0 and 1, meaning that the intensity of highlighting can be configured instead of just being ON/OFF
    -   `getHighlighted()` previously returned Boolean, now `getHighlight()` returns Number
-   Auto cursor now works when mouse is over a series with mouse interactions enabled.
    -   Previously this required user to disable mouse interactions with `series.setMouseInteractions(false)`
-   `onHighlight` parameter can now be `number` or `boolean`. Previously it was always `boolean`.
-   Changed AutoCursor default behavior.
    -   AutoCursor is no longer disabled during Axis Animations (zooming, scrolling) by default
    -   To restore this behavior, use `ChartXY.setAutoCursorEnabledDuringAxisAnimation(false)`
-   Following components default mouse interactions enabled state changes from false to true:
    -   LineSeries, HeatmapSeries, all 3D series
    -   This will not affect performance in any way. By default this will result in these series highlighting when interacted above.
    -   To disable this, use setHighlightOnHover(false)
-   Now axis interactions area expands when axis nibs are disabled.
    -   Axis nibs can be disabled with `axis.setNibInteractionScaleByDragging(false).setNibInteractionScaleByWheeling(false)`
-   Removed `LineStyle.thickness`, please use `LineStyle.getThickness()` instead.
-   `forEachAxis` method now returns `this` instead of `void`
-   UICheckBox 'switch' event is no longer triggered when `setOn()` is called and the state is actually unchanged.
-   Component highlighting is now animated by default.
    -   Animation can be disabled with `setAnimationHighlight(false)`
-   Changed look of LightningChart JS logo that is visible when not using a license.
-   highlighting doesn't touch the alpha channel anymore
-   Changed `LegendBoxAddOptions.disposeOnClick` to `toggleVisibilityOnClick`.
    -   Functionality is also changed to use setVisible internally, rather than dispose
-   Disposing a component can no longer be reverted.
    -   `dispose()` now permanently removes the component.
    -   To temporarily hide a component, use `setVisible(false)` instead
-   Changed default cursor result table formatter of most series types.
    -   Use `series.setCursorResultTableFormatter` method to alter this behavior.
-   Changed default CustomTick type from `UIElementBuilders.PointableTextBox` to `UIElementBuilders.AxisTickMajor`
-   Renamed NewSurfaceGridSeries3D -> SurfaceGridSeries3D, NewSurfaceGridSeries3DOptions -> SurfaceGridSeries3DOptions
-   Changed LegendBox LUTs to not display relative distances between step values. This was done to improve use of space and avoid overlapping labels in cases where LUT steps deltas increase exponentially.
    -   The previous display behavior can be restored with `UILUTCheckBox.setLUTDisplayProportionalSteps` method
-   LegendBoxes are now not draggable by default.
    -   To revert to previous behavior add `legend.setDraggingMode(UIDraggingModes.draggable)` after LB is created.
-   Renamed `Axis.isStopped` to `Axis.getStopped`
-   Slightly altered behavior of `Axis.setInterval` 4th parameter `disableScrolling`
    -   Renamed to `stopAxisAfter`
    -   Before, the method released the Axis unless the `disableScrolling = true`
    -   Now, the method stops the Axis unless `stopAxisAfter = false`
    -   Essentially very similar behavior, but now works a little bit more logically. Usage should not be affected by this change
-   Axis API 'onScaleChange' was changed to 'onIntervalChange' and accepts a callback function with 3 parameters that return axis itself, start and end values
    -   Previous event accepted only 2 parameters, start and end
-   Wrapped parameters of `Axis.setInterval` method in an object
    -   Previous use: `Axis.setInterval(start, end)` -> `Axis.setInterval({ start, end })`
    -   Parameter `disableScrolling` was renamed to `stopAxisAfter` and has a 'true' value by default
-   Library now targets ES6 version instead of ES5.
-   Previously optional `Theme` properties are no longer optional.
    -   `uiTickFont`
    -   `uiTickStrokeStyle`
    -   `uiTickTextFillStyle`
    -   `uiPointableTextBoxFont`
    -   `uiPointableTextBoxStrokeStyle`
    -   `uiPointableTextBoxTextFillStyle`
    -   `uiPointableTextBoxFillStyle`
    -   `lcjsBackgroundFillStyle`
    -   `lcjsBackgroundStrokeStyle`
    -   `heatmapGridSeriesFillStyle`
    -   `heatmapGridSeriesWireframeStyle`
    -   `surfaceSeriesWireframeStyle`
    -   `resultTableTextFont`
    -   `polarAreaSeriesStrokeStyle`
    -   `polarAreaSeriesFillStyle`
-   Loosened types of `LineStyle` and `emptyLine`. This should not cause any issues with existing applications, but should make it easier to use the library with type safety.
-   ImageFill.sourceMissingColor default value changed from opaque black to completely transparent black.
-   Slightly tweaked default legend, checkbox and lut checkbox style and layout.
-   Changed UI layout behavior (UIElementColumn/UIElementRow)
    -   Before layout was "center oriented", its members were aligned around the entire layouts center.
    -   Now, members are aligned to the start of layout (top for Row and left for Column). This should feel more logical than before.

### Removed

-   Heatmap grid series legend entries are no longer colored based on wireframe style
-   Changed default Chart3D bounding box stroke style to `emptyLine`
    -   Use `Chart3D.setBoundingBoxStrokeStyle` to specify bounding box stroke style.
-   Added little bit of default left padding to `UICheckBox` and `UIButtonBox`
-   Changed default right padding in XY chart from 10px to 24px
    -   To change right padding, use ChartXY.setPadding({ right: 10 })
-   Enabled Axis3D scroll animation by default.
    -   To restore previous behavior, use `Axis3D.setAnimationScroll(false)` for each 3D axis.
    -   Axes can be referenced like this `Chart3D.getDefaultAxisX()`.
-   Improved line anti-aliasing quality.
    -   Primitive lines, with only hardware anti-aliasing, can now be drawn by setting the line thickness to `-1`.
    -   Previously primitive lines were used when line thickness was set to `1`, now to use primitive lines you will need to use `-1` as the thickness.
    -   By default lines with thickness of `1` are now rendered with higher quality anti-aliasing.
-   Improved track-pad interactions with ChartXY and Chart3D (previously it was much too sensitive).
    -   Known issue: track-pad is still too sensitive on Safari.
-   LightningChart JS now uses `WebGL 2` whenever supported. This shouldn't introduce any major difference to existing applications and users. If anything, `WebGL 2` should work better.
-   `DateTimeTickStrategy.setFormatting...` methods now allow supplying `undefined` for any value (only overriding particular settings).
-   `DateTimeTickStrategy.setFormattingSecond` now allows configuring formatting of minor ticks at that level.
    -   This option was incorrectly missing before.
-   Charts now automatically trigger layout operation when chart container is resized.
    -   This is done by using a ResizeObserver if the browser has support for it.
-   `TriangulatedPoints3DProperties.size` can now be `Coord3D`. This allows drawing 3D points with sizes on X, Y and Z Axes.
-   `ZoomBandChart` band is now drawn above series.
-   `ZoomBandChart` now supports Heatmap series (non-scrolling variant only).
-   `ZoomBandChart` can now be attached to several axis by supplying an array instead of just one axis when it is created.
-   `ZoomBandChart` now automatically aligns its right side according to reference charts.
    -   Previously only left side was aligned.
-   Tweaks to default Axis ticks
    -   In XY charts, ticks that do not fit no longer display their tickline and gridline. Previously, only the label was hidden.
    -   Fixed Numeric major ticks sometimes behaving strange when there is little axis space available. For example, showing 1, 3, 5 instead of 0, 2, 4, 6.
    -   Numeric minor ticks are no longer displayed if the axis is shorter than 50 pixels.
    -   Slightly adjusted the selection of Numeric tick level. Larger tick levels are now activated slightly less eagerly.
-   ChartXY title no longer allocates top & bottom margins when title length is ''

-   Fixed `IntensityGrid` and `IntensityMesh` not rendering after restored when using `IndividualPointFill`.
-   Fixed `Axis` event API having some incorrect typings (wheel, drag & touch events) and callback not receiving all arguments.
-   Fixed `HeatmapScrollingGridSeriesIntensityValues` scrolling sometimes behaving strangely (pausing or skipping ahead).
-   Fixed `Axis` animations sometimes not disabled even if chart animations are disabled.
-   Fixed touch events not properly cancelled when touch event goes over OSM.
-   Fixed XY and Polar Axis sometimes rendering incorrectly for 1 frame after window resize.

### Deprecated

-   Deprecated `Chart3D.addSurfaceSeries`
    -   To keep using surface grid series, use `Chart3D.addSurfaceGridSeries`.
        -   This is a new series type with slightly changed API and greatly increased performance
    -   To keep using surface mesh series, use `Chart3D.addSurfaceMeshSeries`
